Old Statistical methods are still popular, along with LSTMs and RNNs. This is partially related to the fact that the prediction task, like any other data-related task, requires creativity in so many aspects and definitely requires research. In spite of the large number of formal quality metrics and approaches to parameters estimation, it is often necessary to try something different for each time series. 

Also, the balance between quality and cost is important. We have sen that the SARIMAX model can produce excellent  results after tuning but requires more time of laborious data manipulation while a simple linear regression model can be built in 10 minutes and can achieve more or less the same results. Frantly, when I say more 0r less, it is always on the lesser side when the accuracy is considered.
